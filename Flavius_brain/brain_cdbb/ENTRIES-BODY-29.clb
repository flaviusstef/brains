<p><b>Activity: safety check [1]</b></p>
<p>After you present the retrospective agenda, people rank 1-5 how safe they feel in the meeting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not comfortable being here, I want to leave</li>
<li>Not comfortable talking, even when I have a strong opinion, will keep it to myself</li>
<li>Happy to sit and listen, will talk if something I am very passionate about comes up</li>
<li>Talk about most things, but small few topics I may keep quiet on</li>
<li>Talk about anything, want to explore other's thoughts as well as my own</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have many 1, 2, 3's ask people to anonymously provide suggestions for improvement. If applicable, try to apply the and re-run safety check. If not, abort the retrospective.</p>
